🔋 **Battery Health Analysis (LFP + NMC)**

**Optimizing Charging Cycles Through Data Analysis**

This project explores how charging cycles and depth of discharge affect battery health (State of Health / SoH) using two battery types: LFP and NMC.  
It combines data analysis, visualization, and a simple predictive RNN model to generate actionable insights for optimizing battery lifespan.

📊 **Project Overview**  
Objective:  
Analyze large-scale battery data to identify how charging habits and usage patterns impact battery degradation, and provide recommendations to extend battery life.  
Battery Types:  
- LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate)
- NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt)
Dataset Size: ~1.5 million rows → cleaned to ~420k usable rows.

🧹 Data Cleaning Example
Filtering unrealistic voltage and current values:
df_clean = df[(df['Voltage'] >= 2500) & (df['Voltage'] <= 4200)]
df_clean = df_clean[(df['Current'] >= 0.1) & (df['Current'] <= 1000)]
print("Cleaned dataset:", df_clean.shape)

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
Trend: SoH consistently decreases with higher cycle count → natural degradation.
Correlation:
Capacity ↔ SoH = +1.0
DoD ↔ SoH = -1.0
Voltage ↔ SoH = -0.96
Distribution: Most batteries maintain >95% SoH, but deep discharges accelerate drop.
Key Findings:
Optimal charging range: 20–80% SoC
Ideal daily cycles: 1–2 cycles/day
Deep discharge (>80% DoD) significantly accelerates degradation.

🧠 RNN Modeling
A simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) was trained to predict SoH trends based on historical sensor data.
This model validates the same behavioral patterns observed in EDA.
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import SimpleRNN, Dense

model = Sequential([
    SimpleRNN(64, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2]), activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='linear')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_val, y_val),
                    epochs=30, batch_size=32)
Results:
RNN achieved lowest error (MAE ≈ 0.7%, MAPE ≈ 2.3%).
Confirms strong influence of Depth of Discharge and Capacity on SoH degradation.

💡 Recommendations
For Users:
Charge between 20–80% for longer battery life.
Limit to 1–2 charge cycles per day.
Avoid full discharge (<10% SoC).
For Businesses / Engineers:
Implement dashboards (Power BI/Tableau) to monitor SoH in real time.
Focus on tracking DoD and Capacity as key predictive features.
Add temperature data for more robust modeling in future.
